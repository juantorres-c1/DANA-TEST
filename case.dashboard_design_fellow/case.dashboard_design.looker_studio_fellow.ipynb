Management is keen to find out what the most popular items are and which locations are the most profitable in order to adjust their marketing strategies and their stock logistics to increase sales and revenue. They also want to learn about the number of deliveries made outside Florida since they are contemplating opening a new branch in another state.\n\n**Business Problem.** You are tasked with creating a sales dashboard for management to use. You already designed the dashboard and chose what charts will be included. **Your task now is to build the dashboard using [Looker Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)**, Google's free Business Intelligence tool. Remember that the managers are interested in having these three broad questions answered:\n\n1. How have our sales, revenue, and profits evolved over time?\n2. What are the locations with the highest numbers of sales and profit?\n3. What are the items with the highest numbers of sales, profit, and revenue across product description, product type, product line, location, customer age group, and state of delivery?\n\n**Analytical Context.** You have been given a sample dataset of 5000 sales records from Simply Music, corresponding to the years 2018 and 2019. The data points are in the [`simply_music.csv`](data/simply_music.csv) file.",
