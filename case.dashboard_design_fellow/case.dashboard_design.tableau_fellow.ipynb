Management is keen to find out what the most popular items are and which locations are the most profitable in order to adjust their marketing strategies and their stock logistics to increase sales and revenue. They also want to learn about the number of deliveries made outside Florida since they are contemplating opening a new branch in another state.\n\n**Business Problem.** You are tasked with creating a sales dashboard for management to use. You already designed the dashboard and chose what charts will be included. Your task now is to **build the dashboard using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop)**, one of the leading Business Intelligence (BI) tools in the market. Remember that the managers are interested in having these three broad questions answered:\n\n1. How have our sales, revenue, and profits evolved over time?\n2. What are the locations with the highest numbers of sales and profit?\n3. What are the items with the highest numbers of sales, profit, and revenue across product description, product type, product line, location, customer age group, and state of delivery?\n\n**Analytical Context.** You have been given a sample dataset of 5000 sales records from Simply Music, corresponding to the years 2018 and 2019. The data points are in the [`simply_music_tableau.csv`](data/simply_music_tableau.csv) file.",

Its flagship product, the powerful [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop), is a direct competitor of other BI suites like PowerBI and Google Data Studio and has seen an increase in popularity in the last few years. It is an excellent tool for data analysis and a must-know if you want to have a career as a data professional.\n\nWe will be developing our dashboard using [Tableau Public](https://www.tableau.com/products/public), which is the free version of Tableau Desktop. If you use this free version, all of your dashboards will be published on the web. You can also use the web version of Tableau, but there are some minor differences in functionality compared to the desktop version. [Here](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/) is a gallery of some nice dashboards that people have uploaded to Tableau Public in the past.",

Don't hide your dashboards - only the worksheets where the individual charts were created.\n2. Go to \"File -> Save to Tableau Public\" to save your dashboard online. Tableau will open a web browser tab where you will find your published dashboard.\n3. On the Tableau website, click on the gear icon and toggle the \"Show sheets\" selector to activate it. This will make both dashboards show as tabs on the Tableau Public website:\n\n\n<video controls src=\"data/videos/t_show_as_tabs.mp4\" />\n\nYou can then click on the share icon, which is two places to the left of the gear icon, and copy the link to your dashboard.
