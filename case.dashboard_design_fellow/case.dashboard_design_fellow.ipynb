Management is keen to find out what the most popular items are and which locations are the most profitable in order to adjust their marketing strategies and their stock logistics to increase sales and revenue. They also want to learn about the number of deliveries made outside Florida since they are contemplating opening a new branch in another state.\n\n**Business Problem.** You are tasked with creating a sales dashboard for management to use. This dashboard must display sales, revenue, and profit over time and allow for queries across product, location, and customer age. From your previous meetings with the management, you know that they are interested in having these three broad questions answered:\n\n1. How have our sales, revenue, and profits evolved over time?\n2. What are the locations with the highest numbers of sales and profit?\n3. What are the items with the highest numbers of sales, profit, and revenue across product description, product type, product line, location, customer age group, and state of delivery?\n\n**Analytical Context.** You have been given a sample dataset of 5,000 sales records from Simply Music corresponding to the years 2018 and 2019. They ask you to create the dashboard with this sample data, and after this is done, and your dashboard receives approval, your team will have to connect it to an online database to feed it the real-time data that comes from the company's sales tracking software. The sample table and the database share the same structure, so you don't have to worry about database management or creation.",

      "source": "## Understanding the business process\n\nData professionals are often required to extract valuable information from datasets without being given specific questions to answer. We usually address these cases with exploratory data analysis combined with domain knowledge. Other times, we can get the clients to articulate a limited set of questions. There is a third scenario, where the clients want to explore the data themselves in such a way that they can easily answer *ad-hoc* queries that can't possibly be known in advance. This is much more open-ended and requires us to intimately understand the natural structure of the data and likely queries.\n\nOne way to address this need is to create **dashboards** that organize and display all relevant business information along with various filters that users might want to have, while being fully extensible if required in the future. When you create dashboards, you define a set of relevant variables and feed them into interactive visualizations that the users can then filter at will to explore relationships among the variables. Here are some examples:\n\n![Dashboard 1](data/images/d1.png)\n<br><br><br>\n![Dashboard 2](data/images/d2.png)\n<br><br><br>\n![Dashboard 3](data/images/d3.png)\n\nDashboards work best when they mirror the business processes that underlie the data. It is *always* advised that you study the greater business context so that you can put yourself into the shoes of your end users (in this case, management) and deliver a product that is user-friendly and pertinent.",

The customers are not restricted to a single state, and in fact, many of them buy online from all over the country. But they also have three physical shops located in the state of Florida. These are the product lines that the store serves:\n\n1. Musical instruments\n    1. Acoustic pianos\n    2. Digital pianos and keyboards\n    3. Guitars (electric and acoustic)\n    4. Woodwinds (flutes, oboes, bassoons, saxophones, etc.)\n    5. Brass (trumpets, horns)\n    6. Synthesizers\n    7. Strings (everything bowed: violins, cellos, etc.)\n    8. Percussion (mostly drum kits)\n2. Accessories\n    1. Strings (for guitars, violins, etc.)\n    2. Pedals and amps (for electric guitars)\n    3. Sheet music\n\nFurthermore, these are the four selling channels that the company uses:\n\n1. Physical store in Fort Lauderdale\n2. Physical store in Tampa\n3. Physical store in West Palm Beach\n4. Online store\n\nEach transaction is recorded at the time of purchasing, whether the purchase happens online or at a physical location. Accepted means of payment include cash and credit card. If the customer is not happy with their product, they can file a complaint within 10 days of the purchase.",

You can always represent your data in tabular form, and that's sometimes more appropriate than a visual chart. The general principle is that you should keep tables simple and uncluttered. If that's not possible, then try some of the other visualizations explained above.\n\nA common use case of tables is when you need to do a **cross-tabulation (crosstab)** of two categorical variables. Crosstabs (a.k.a. contingency tables), count the number of elements of category A that also belong to category B and present the results in a table:\n\n| Type | Physical | Online |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Guitars | 40 | 60 |\n| Acc. Pianos | 30 | 50 |\n\nThis table shows that there were 40 guitars sold in a physical location. To learn more about contingency tables, check out [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table).\n\nYou can display a crosstab as-is in your dashboard if you like, but you can also slice it with a filter and then plot the relevant slice as a bar chart or a pie chart. Let's say you use a filter to slice out \"online\" (i.e., you only want to see sales from physical locations), which means the resulting plot can be:\n\n<img src=\"data/images/physical_crosstab_plot.jpg\" width=\"500\"/>\n\nIn addition to these alternatives, you can also display single values using **scorecards**, like this:\n\n<img src=\"data/images/scorecard.jpg\" width=\"100\"/>",

A good dashboard is like a restaurant menu that categorizes the meals, arranges them in hierarchies according to what the customer wants to read first, and provides only the information needed to make a decision. If the customer wants to learn more about a dish (e.g., the specific ingredients used or the name of the chef), they would have to ask the waiter or waitress. Likewise, your dashboard should present the most relevant information first and show more detailed information only if the user asks for it.\n\nKeep the following image in mind; it will help us as we move forward:\n\n<img src=\"data/images/menu.jpg\" width=\"500\"/>\n\nA good way to organize our dashboard is by creating **pages**. These are screens that show different aspects of your data, and the end user can switch between them by using a menu bar. Let's start with a basic set of pages - a \"Bird's-Eye View\" page (with an overview of the metrics) and a \"Detailed View\" page (which has more information and more filters).\n\nOur dashboard will have three main layout components - a sidebar, a banner, and a body:\n\n<img src=\"data/images/main_layout.jpg\" width=\"500\"/>\n\nThe sidebar will contain links to the pages. The banner will have the title of the page and optionally notes, date filters, and scorecards. The page body will contain the visualizations.",

What are the items with the highest numbers of sales, profit, and revenue across product description, product type, product line, location, customer age group, and state of delivery?\n\nThe third question has lots of dimensions, so we can put it in the \"Detailed View\" page. Let's put the first two questions in the \"Bird's-Eye View\" page.\n\nWe know that the first question can be answered using line plots.

Since we want to know sales and total profit for each item, it makes sense to have a chart for sales (measured in number of items) and a chart for profit (measured in dollars). The count of items and the sum of dollars are both numeric (the former is an integer, the latter is a float). As item names are categorical, bar charts would be fine. (Pie charts might not be easy to interpret because there are many products, and thus, the charts would get crowded).\n\nIf you recall the `products` table, you'll remember that each product has a line (\"Musical instruments\"), a type (\"Guitars\"), and a description (\"Fender American Stratocaster\"). To avoid having to create a page-level filter for each one of these variables, we can add them to a single \"Items\" chart as **drill-down** variables. Drill-down allows you to select one element of a chart and move to a lower level in the hierarchy. The following video may be helpful to understand this concept than a mere description in words (this is a bar chart of sales by item, with drill-down by line, type, and description):\n\n\n<video controls src=\"data/videos/drill_down.mp4\" />",

You also need to be familiar with the different types of visualizations and their strengths and weaknesses, and keep some basic design principles in mind as well. This allows you to build a dashboard that is functional but also not cluttered. Some key ideas you might want to keep in mind for the future are:\n\n* *Dashboards are like restaurant menus.* They must be clear, straightforward and avoid overwhelming the user with too much information. Don't forget BLUF: Bottom Line Up Front. Put the most important details first and foremost, where it's easiest to read.\n* *Your visualizations should be organized hierarchically.* The visuals that answer the most important questions come first. Visuals dedicated to answering secondary questions can be placed more to the right or bottom and be presented in a smaller size\n* *Each visualization must answer a business question*, so it is always a good practice to label the chart or table with the question/purpose. You should also add explanatory text when you feel your users would appreciate it. However, if you find yourself adding too much text, then perhaps it is because your dashboard is not clear enough by itself, and you should re-evaluate your layout or visualizations\n\nAdditionally, drill-down and charts that double as page-level filters can save you a lot of space because you don't need to add more controls (like drop-down lists) to act as filters in the page. Not everything should be drillable though, because the dashboard should be kept as simple as possible.",
