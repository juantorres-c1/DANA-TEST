To keep up with current consumer trends, the shop's owner has decided to start serving delivery orders that customers place via WhatsApp. Last week, several unusually large orders were returned because their prices were incorrectly calculated. So far, this process has been carried out manually using pen, paper, and a pocket calculator. It seems that news about the ability to order via WhatsApp is spreading very rapidly via word-of-mouth, and the shop owner is worried that the shop will not be able to keep up with the increasing number of large orders that require lengthy and error-prone calculations.\n\n**Business Problem.** Your task is to **come up with a way to simplify the process of calculating the total price of each order and make it more exact and reliable**.\n\n**Analytical Context.** The owner has provided you with an order from one of her most loyal customers and a laptop with Microsoft Excel installed on it. She wants you to set up a demo of how the new process would work. Here's the order:\n\n<img src=\"data/images/order.png\" alt=\"Michelle's order\" style=\"width:220px\">\n\n**Note:** The screenshots below show the \"classic\" look of Excel Online's ribbon, which may be different from the default look you get the first time you open it.

Once you open a workbook, you will see that it contains one or more **worksheets** that you can access from the tabs at the bottom of the screen:\n\n![Worksheet tab](data/images/worksheets.png)\n\nIn each worksheet, you will see a horizontal row of letters at the top border of the grid. Those letters represent the columns in which information is being stored:\n\n![Columns](data/images/columns.png)\n\nThere's also a column of numbers to the left. These numbers represent the rows in which information is being stored:\n\n![Rows](data/images/rows.png)\n\nTo identify a cell, we use its column and row coordinates. Thus, this cell:\n\n![A1](data/images/a1.png)\n\nwill be called A1, and this cell:\n\n![s50](data/images/s50.png)\n\nwill be called S50. When a cell is selected, its border becomes green and visually thicker than the borders of the surrounding cells.\n\n\nAt the top of your screen, you will see various menus that allow you to change font size and color (similar to Microsoft Word), add borders, insert plots, and access a myriad of other functions that we will cover in future cases. Below the menus, you will also see the formula bar (denoted with $f_x$ to the left), where you can see the contents of the cell which is currently selected (we highlighted the formula bar with an orange rectangle in the image below):\n\n![menus](data/images/menus.png)",

The way these shortcuts work is that you select the cell you want to copy and then hit **\"Ctrl + C\"** to copy it. Then, you select the cell where you want to paste it and hit **\"Ctrl + V\"**. Another important shortcut that you will probably be using a lot is **\"Ctrl + Z\"**.

Left-click on cell E4 and hold down the mouse while dragging the cursor down to the last cell you want to paste the formula in (in this case, cell E12), then hit \"Ctrl + V\" just once. (This is shown at the end of the GIF above.)\n2. After selecting cell E4, hit **\"Ctrl + Shift + &darr;\"** to highlight everything in column E from cell E4 onwards. Then hit \"Ctrl + V\" just once. (However, note that this will paste the formula beyond cell E12).\n3. Left-click on the green square in the bottom right-hand corner of cell E4 and hold down the mouse while dragging the cursor down to cell E12. Release the mouse, and you're done! (You don't even need to hit \"Ctrl + V\".)\n\nTry these out (especially 2 and 3)! We will use the latter two much more in future Excel cases.",

Another advantage is that Excel workbooks can be saved for later, making it much easier for her to keep track of orders over time!\n\nNow, you might be thinking that having to insert unit prices manually is still a bit error-prone, and that is absolutely correct. To spare you from having to do this, Excel also has some more advanced functions (not covered here) that allow you to have all the unit prices in one dedicated spreadsheet, which you can pull in as needed from other spreadsheets.",
