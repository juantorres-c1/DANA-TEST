As an analyst with a basketball team, you would likely be aware that the columns are as follows:\n1. **G:** The number of games played by the LA Lakers. This runs from `1` to `82`, the number of regular season games the team played.\n2. **GP:** The number of games LeBron has played in. For games he didn't play, it will show an \"NaN\", which stands for \"not a number\" and represents a missing value. The first game he started is `1`, then `2`, etc.\n3. **Date:** The date of the game in the format year-month-day hour:minute:second. You do not need the time details, so it is okay that those are zeros. To learn more about SQL date formatting, or how to extract information from the timestamp, read the information [here.](https://dataschool.com/learn-sql/dates/) \n4. **Month:** The calendar month of the game.\n5. **Year:** The calendar year of the game.\n6. **Home/Away:** Home games are played in Los Angeles, away games are played at the opponent's stadium.\n7. **Opp:** A three-letter designation of the team they played. For instance, 'GSW' stands for the 'Golden State Warriors'.\n8. **GS:** Game started; shows if LeBron started the game. If he did, the value is `1`. Otherwise, the column is empty and registers as \"NaN\".\n9. **REBS:** Number of rebounds.\n10. **AST:** Number of assists.\n11. **STL:** Number of steals.\n12. **BLK:** Number of blocks.\n13. **PF:** Number of personal fouls.\n14. **PTS:** Number of points scored.\n\nNote that REBS, AST, STL, BLK, PF, and PTS are personal stats that give an idea of how the player performed in the game. High numbers are better than low numbers, except for PF. You can find more details on basketball statistics [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_statistics) or [here.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)",

      "source": "### NULL values\n\nA **NULL value** is a special marker used in SQL to indicate that a data value does not exist in the database.\n\nIt is important to note that while NULL values represent missing data, they are different from the value of \"zero\". In fact, a value of zero is not a NULL value, and in a given context, it's useful for them to be differentiated. Let's explore this a little more. Consider the BLK (Number of Blocks) column which has both zeros (like in row 2) and NULL values (like in rows 4 and 5). The zeros in this context state two things: LeBron played in the game and in said game, LeBron didn't block any shots, whereas the NULL values are missing because he didn't play the game, so of course he couldn't have made any blocks. If the NULL values were represented as zeros, and you wanted to know how many games LeBron played where he had zero blocks, it would be much more difficult to do so.\n\nThere will be countless times in which you will be working with data that has many missing values. Throughout this case, you will learn how to identify counts, percentages and best practices to work with missing data in SQL. ",

Aggregating accurately: Being able to find accurate means, medians and modes of multiple columns can be difficult if instead of NULL, there is a zero. SQL ignores NULL values, so if you want to take the mean of a column, and there are 30 rows with 10 NULLS, the function will sum up the existing rows and divide by 20.   \n\n\n2. If a certain number of null values are present, it might not even be worth analyzing the data. We need to determine the minimum amount of null values in the dataset in order to conduct a valuable analysis. In the case of the basketball data we're using, the NULL values are important, because they represent games the player has not played. When computing performance data, we may need to know what is missing, as much as we need to know what is there. If we were looking at survey data, and more than half of the data is missing, we might need to find a better dataset to represent the population.  \n\nIn the data here, nulls carry information. They mean the player was not active, and did not accrue any statistics. We're going to use this dataset to practice counting NULL values and using them to find out how much data is present, and how much is missing.",
