Today your boss obtained a nice COVID-19 dataset and wants you to help him with a quick report to include in one of his presentations. He would like you to find how many confirmed cases there were between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 9, 2021, for each state and save the results to a text file. He also needs to know how many cumulative cases there have been in the entire US.\n\nThe data came to you in a folder called `confirmed`, which has 52 subfolders inside, one folder for each US state + 2 territories. Inside each subfolder, there are plain text files, one file per county. These files have 385 rows each because there were 385 days between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 9, 2021.\n\nThese data represent cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 per county. That means that the numbers report not only how many people got sick that day but also how many had had COVID-19 before (since Jan 22, 2020), including those who recovered, those who didn't recover, and those who caught the virus more than once.",

To read the lines of the file and save them as a list, you use `list_of_lines = file.readlines()`.\n* **For loops**. This diagram shows the different parts of a `for` loop block:\n\n![For loops](data/images/for_anatomy.png)\n\n* **Populating a list iteratively:** This is a common task, so save the snippet:\n\n~~~python\nlist_to_populate = []\nfor item in some_sequence:\n    new_item = some_function(item)\n    list_to_populate.append(new_item)\n~~~\n\n* **Getting a list of all the files with `extension` in a directory (directory is just another name for \"folder\")**:\n\n~~~python\nimport glob\nlist_of_files = glob.glob(\"path/to/directory/*.extension\")\n~~~\n\nTwo important things to notice here. First, if you are not familiar with the term **extension**, it is simply the text that comes after the dot in file names. Extensions help identify the file type. For instance, `my_excel.xlsx` has the `.xslx` extension, which identifies Excel files, and `my_image.png` has the `.png` extension, which tells you this is a PNG image file. The second important thing is that this snippet uses an asterisk (`*`) as a **wildcard**. In this context, this symbol tells Python to take into account all the files that are inside that folder ending in `.extension`. So, for instance, this code would catch `hello.extension` and `goodbye.extension` but not `this_is.anotherextension`. Wildcards are placeholders that stand for some undetermined text before or after some other known text.\n* **Getting a list of all the subdirectories in a directory**:\n\n~~~python\nimport os\nlist_of_subfolders = os.listdir(\"path/to/directory\")\n~~~\n\n\n* **Nested `for` loops:** To nest a `for` loop inside another `for` loop, you have to indent the inner loop (the statements of the inner loop will therefore be indented twice).\n* **Creating a file, writing a line, and saving the file to disk**: This is a generic snippet to do that:\n\n~~~python\nnew_file_to_save = open(\"path/to/folder/name_of_new_file.txt\", \"w\")\nline = \"Some text to write\"\nnew_file_to_save.write(line)\nnew_file_to_save.close()\n~~~",
