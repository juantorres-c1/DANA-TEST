You can see that while there are only three rows in this table, there are many more columns that make the spreadsheet very wide horizontally. This data format does not easily lend itself to the type of analysis that we want to do, mainly due to the fact that each demographic group is in its own column.  This will make it difficult to perform the grouping and aggregations necessary to calculate the population totals by demographic group. We will be cleaning up this data shortly, but first, we will dive deeper into this wide data format.\n",

Each column associated with a candidate's row contains different data points about them, including age, sex, and votes. When we look back at our census data, we can see that the first row corresponds to the census variable of a particular demographic group, the second row refers to the name of that group, and the third row refers to the population size of that group.\n",
