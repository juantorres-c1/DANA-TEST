She has been trying to carry out the classification using a popular spreadsheet package, but last night she accidentally deleted half of her formulas, and now her file is unusable. To make things worse, she didn't keep any backups. You found out about this and offered to help her out.\n\nThis is the decision tree she is using (a decision tree is just a [flow chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) that represents decision rules):\n\n![Decision tree - animals](data/images/animals_decision_tree.png)\n\nLet's break down this diagram:\n\n1. **Does this animal fly?** If this animal does fly, move on to the next stage. If this animal does not fly, then don't assign it to any category.\n2. **Is this animal warm-blooded?** So far, we only have animals that fly. If this animal is also warm-blooded, move on to the next stage. If it isn't, classify it as an insect.\n3. **Does this animal feed on blood?** Now we have animals that fly, *and* are warm-blooded. If this animal also feeds on blood, then classify it as a bat. If it doesn't, classify it as a bird (we know that there are bats that don't feed on blood, but let's just assume that there aren't any of those in your friend's sample).\n\nIn other words,\n\n* If an animal flies, is warm-blooded, and feeds on blood, it is a bat.\n* If an animal flies, is warm-blooded, and doesn't feed on blood, it is a bird.\n* If an animal flies and is not warm-blooded, it is an insect.\n* If an animal doesn't fly, it should not be assigned to any category - we're only interested in animals that fly.\n\nNow execute the following cell:",

      "source": "## A word on Boolean logic\n\nSo far, our conditionals have evaluated a single condition to determine which lines of code actually get executed when we run it. Python can also evaluate multiple conditions at once, using what we call **[Boolean logic](https://www.pbs.org/video/boolean-logic-logic-gates-crash-course-computer-science-nobmpt/)**.\n\nThere are four Boolean operations that will suffice in the vast majority of cases:\n\n* $AND$, which in Python is `and`,\n* $OR$, which in Python is `or`,\n* $XOR$ or **exclusive or**, which in Python is `^`, and\n* $NOT$, which in Python is `not`.\n\nThis is related to the set operations that we covered in Case 0.3. In fact, you can represent Boolean logic [using sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#Diagrammatic_representations).\n\n### $AND$\n\nYou have two boolean variables, `A` and `B`. This is the **truth table** related to the $AND$ operation when applied to them (a truth table is just a matrix that shows the output of a Boolean operation for different values of `A` and `B`):\n\n| Value of `A`\t| Value of `B`  | Value of `A and B`|\n|------------\t|------------\t|------------------\t|\n| False      \t| False      \t| False            \t|\n| False      \t| True       \t| False            \t|\n| True       \t| False      \t| False            \t|\n| True       \t| True       \t| True             \t|\n\nIn other words, `A and B` is `True` only when both conditions are `True`.\n\n### $OR$\n\nThis is the truth table for the $OR$ operation:\n\n| Value of `A`\t| Value of `B`  | Value of `A or B` |\n|------------\t|------------\t|------------------\t|\n| False      \t| False      \t| False            \t|\n| False      \t| True       \t| True            \t|\n| True       \t| False      \t| True            \t|\n| True       \t| True       \t| True             \t|\n\nIn other words, `A or B` is always `True` except when both conditions are `False`.\n\n### $XOR$\n\nThis is the truth table for the exclusive or operation:\n\n| Value of `A`\t| Value of `B`  | Value of `A ^ B`  |\n|------------\t|------------\t|------------------\t|\n| False      \t| False      \t| False            \t|\n| False      \t| True       \t| True            \t|\n| True       \t| False      \t| True            \t|\n| True       \t| True       \t| False            \t|\n\nIn other words, `A ^ B` is `True` only when both conditions have different truth values.\n\n### $NOT$\n\nNegation is the easiest of the operators. It just reverses the value of your boolean. So, if `A` is `True`, then `not A` will be `False`. It takes only one argument, so you can't do `A not B` (but you *can* do `not (A and B)`, for instance).\n\n---\n\nNow let's look at an example. Let's evaluate an $OR$ operation:",
