In recent years, it has been working on developing an analytics platform called [OU Analyse](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/) to track student performance across its many programs, with the aim of reducing dropout and increasing student engagement and learning. Their analytics team is growing, and they have been actively looking to hire strong candidates. You have been shortlisted as one of them.\n\n**Business problem:** As part of the interviewing process, you have been given an anonymized dataset and asked to **compute the GPA (Grade Point Average) for all students in the October 2014 cohort and create a Tableau dashboard that includes their GPAs and demographic data**.\n\n**Analytical context:** You will be working with a subset of the [OULA dataset](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset), which contains demographic and assessment data for a number of UK-based students from the October 2014 cohort (coded as `2014J`). The data is in the [OULA.xlsm](data/OULA.xlsm) file (click on the file name to download the file). You will find four worksheets in this Excel file:\n\n* `student_info` contains demographic information about students as well as which \"module\" (course) they were enrolled in and whether they received a pass or a fail, or dropped out.\n* `modules` lists the different modules that the students could enroll in. The actual names have been replaced with three-letter codes for privacy reasons.\n* `assessments` has a table with all the assessments for each module, indicating the weight that each assessment had in the final grade.\n* `student_assessment` contains the actual grades that each student received in each assessment on a 0-100 scale. Most students in this sample only enrolled in one course, but there are some who enrolled in more.\n\nThe full documentation can be found [here](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset#description).\n\n**Deliverable:** In this extended case, you will be submitting 1 excel file that contains all of the exercise answers and your Tableau Dashboard link.",

For instance, in this dataset, at one point Excel converted all `10-20` under `imd_band` to `October 20`, which is a typical behavior for Excel. Those anomalous values were later removed, but this leaves us with missing values. You are not expected to do any data cleaning here.",

Keep it as clean as you can, and if you need to add several charts, distribute them in pages (dashboards).\n\n* The Tableau charts should **employ the \"Use as filter\" functionality**. This way an arbitrary number of filters can be applied to the charts using all the dimensions without requiring the addition of new charts or filter controls. For instance, you can have a vertical bar graph with age range, and when you select one of the bars, the rest of the charts adjust to show you the students by region, gender, etc. for that age range.\n\n* All the **charts must be of the appropriate type according to the data they represent**. In this case, going with all bar charts (or column charts) is a safe option. You do not have to create a choropleth map. It may be especially difficult to do so because the region data is not formatted for Tableau. \n\n* Every chart must have a **descriptive title and chart axes must be clearly labeled**.\n\nYou will need to both *design and implement* the dashboards yourself, using the principles and tutorials you saw in previous cases.
