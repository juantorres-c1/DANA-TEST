If you are charged five dollars, and someone else is charged 10 dollars, you can easily say they were charged twice as much as you. **Interval data**, having no true zero, is similar. You can still create many of the same plots and use the same statistics, but since it is impossible to have a BMI of zero, it doesn't really make sense to say someone has double the BMI of someone else. **Ordinal data** is when you have categories with a natural order. BMI could be converted into an example here if you group people into the categories of underweight, normal, overweight, and obese. Those four categories contain a wide range of values but have clear boundaries between categories. This also helps us to see that it is not the name of the variable that tells us its type of data but rather the way the variable is measured. **Nominal data** is simply a collection of categories without a natural ranking. For instance, in the variable of biological sex, you can assign *female* as 0 and *male* as 1, but those values do not mean anything other than representing two different groups."

    "**Histograms** can be used to display the frequency of values in a variable. This allows for a visual understanding of the spread of the data. There is a similar chart to the histogram called a **column chart**. While histograms are used with ratio and interval data, column charts are used with ordinal and nominal data. In a column chart, there is generally a space between the bars to show that the bars represent different categories, but in histograms, there is no space. An additional type of chart, called a **bar chart**, is similar to a column chart but oriented horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a histogram by selecting the column we want to use, selecting the `Insert` tab, and then `Other Charts`. Choose the first item on the left under `Statistical`.\n",

    "At the bottom of this histogram, you can see that each column represents a range of BMI values. You can adjust the width of these values by using the chart format panel and expanding the area that says `Series bmi`. (If you don't see this panel, click `Format` under the `Chart` tab. From there, next to where it says `bins`, the default is `Auto`. You can switch `Auto` to `Number of bins` and then change that default number that appears. By making that number larger or smaller, you can see how the histogram changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, this appears to be a reasonable number of bins to represent the data. This **distribution** looks like what is called a **normal distribution**. A distribution shows us the various values that occur for a variable. In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal, and the data are symmetrical around the median. This distribution has a high peak in the center and tapers off towards the left and right ends. It has been said that the normal distribution is so prevalent in nature that had the Ancient Greeks discovered it, they would have had a god for it.

    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have been concerned with calculating statistical values which give insight into the data we already have; i.e., we have been taking a more *empirical* approach. However, we often have to be forward-looking and also predict the likelihood of future events, which are more *theoretical* in nature. We had a sampling of this in Exercise 4, but here we will talk more in detail about distributions and some of the basic theories around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were to plot the distribution of BMIs for the smokers in our dataset — that would give us a histogram. But a histogram is entirely based on a limited sample of past data and doesn't allow us to directly make predictions about the general smoker population, *independent of our specific dataset*. To do this, we need a **probability density function (PDF)**, which is a theoretical construct that helps us compute the probability of where any randomly chosen smoker's BMI would fall and which is not strictly beholden to the limits of our dataset (caveat: In order to use a PDF as an aid for inference, i.e., to make general claims about a population using data from a sample, we need to pair it with some other techniques that make sure that the sample is representative of the whole).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we didn't say that the PDF can directly tell us the probability that a randomly chosen smoker's BMI would be exactly a given value, say, 30. This is because BMI is a *continuous* value rather than a *discrete* value; it can take on any decimal value, so the probability that a person's BMI is *exactly* 30 is pretty much zero. It's virtually guaranteed that what we think is a 30 BMI is actually a 29.99 BMI, or a 30.01 BMI, or even a 30.001 BMI. Either way, finding a person with a BMI of exactly 30 is like trying to find a unicorn."

The PDF is perfectly made for this - specifically, if we plot the PDF on a standard 2-dimensional coordinate plane (with an $x$-axis and $y$-axis), this probability is the area of the region that lies under the PDF and above 0 (the $x$-axis), with $x$ values between 29 and 31. For those familiar with calculus, this is called the **area under the curve**.\n",

    "\n",
    "From our analysis, we have seen that smokers pay substantially higher fees than non-smokers. Fees for smokers are also strongly correlated with BMI, particularly above the threshold for obesity. It seems that smoking is more common in males than females and is particularly prevalent in the Southeast region, which could account for the higher median charge in that region."

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you saw that by analyzing historical data to understand the trends within it, we could use those trends and some theoretical understanding of probability and statistics to predict the likelihood of future events. Key points include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Summary statistics can be used to quickly indicate where the \"center\" of a dataset is or how spread out the dataset is.\n",
    "3. We can investigate correlations between variables. This is especially useful during exploratory data analysis and when (as you will see in future cases) building models that predict the value of one variable of interest based on several others.\n",
    "3. The probability density function allows us to move from the fully empirical world of histograms, which are an imperfect and limited representation of the entire population, to modeling and inferring characteristics of that population. The area under the PDF between two specific $x$-values $a$ and $b$ gives the probability that a randomly chosen sample from that population will have an $x$-value for that variable between $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "4. The normal distribution is a particularly special PDF that is perfectly symmetrical and has its mean, median, and mode all equal. It is a pretty good fit for many natural phenomena."
