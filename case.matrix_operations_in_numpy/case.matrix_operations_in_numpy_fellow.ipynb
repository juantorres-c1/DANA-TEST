This shortcut becomes more useful when you need to access all the <i>n</i>-th elements of all the sub-arrays. For instance, `my_array[:, 4]` will get you *all* the fifth elements of *all* the sub-arrays of `A`. Notice that this is *different* from `my_array[:][4]`, which first retrieves all the elements of `my_array` and then *only* the fifth element of the result.\n\nTo slice using ranges of positions, you use `my_array[start_range:end_range]`, and so `my_array[3:7]` would retrieve the elements of `my_array` that are between those positions.\n\nLet's slice our photos:",

      "source": "## Appendix\n\nThis is a summary of the operations we covered in this case.\n\n* **Creating arrays**: `np.array(list_or_lists_of_elements, dtype=a_dtype)`. There are [several data types in `numpy`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.types.html), but the ones we used here were `np.int64`, `np.float64`, `np.uint8`, `str`, and `boolean`.\n* **Matrix addition**: `A + B`, where `A` and `B` are `numpy` arrays.\n* **Matrix subtraction**: `A - B`, where `A` and `B` are `numpy` arrays.\n* **Multiplication of a scalar and a matrix**: `r * A`, where `r` is a real number (a scalar), and `A` is a `numpy` array.\n* **Converting an image to a `numpy` array**: `np.asarray(I)` where `I` is a [Pillow image object](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open).\n* **Showing the shape of a `numpy` array**. `A.shape` where `A` is a `numpy` array. Remember that the shape of an array is the number of elements it has in each one of its sub-arrays.\n* **Slicing a `numpy` array:** For the most part, it is just like slicing lists, with the added benefit of being able to use the `:` operator to retrieve all the elements in a subset of the array. For more information, you can find a tutorial [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy_array_slicing.asp).\n* **Converting an array to another data type**: `A.astype(data_type)`, where `A` is a `numpy` array.\n* **Creating an array of random numbers between 0 and 1:** `np.random.rand(shape)`. For instance, `np.random.rand(250,250,3)` will create a matrix of 250 x 250 where each element is itself an array that has 3 elements.\n* **Generating a random integer between two integers:** `np.random.randint(lower_boundary,upper_boundary)`.\n* **Creating a matrix and filling it with a given number:** `np.full(shape, fill_value)`. For instance, `np.full(shape=(25,25), fill_value=0)` will create a 25x25 array full of zeroes.\n* **Creating a copy of an array:** `A.copy()` where `A` is a `numpy` array.\n\n\nThere are lots of applications of matrices, and `numpy` offers a treasure trove of functions to make them possible. Image processing is just one of those applications. We encourage you to learn more about `numpy` in its [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html).",
