Diagrams like the one below are useful for conceptualizing how our database looks from a top-down perspective. As you can see the [primary keys](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.ASP) (`AgentID` and `CustomerID`) from the `agent` and `customer` table exist as [foreign keys](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_foreignkey.ASP) on the `call` table. Note the call table also has its own primary key, `CallID`:\n\n![ERDiagram](data/images/ERDiagram.png)\n\nIt's important to know exactly how our tables interact with one another to perform more advanced queries.

An aggregate function allows you to perform a mathematical calculation on a set of values in your database, then returns a single value that summarizes those values in some way. The following are the most commonly-used SQL aggregate functions:\n\n1. **`COUNT()`** - counts rows in a specified column or table\n2. **`SUM()`** - calculates the sum of values\n3. **`AVG()`** - calculates the average of a set of values\n4. **`MIN()`** - finds the minimum value in a set of values\n5. **`MAX()`** - finds the maximum value in a set of values\n\nIn order to get a general idea of how our agents are performing, let's get a tally of how many calls were made vs. the total products sold. We'll be using `COUNT()` to get the total number of rows in the calls table and `SUM()` to add up all the 1s in the `ProductSold` column:",

[`GROUP BY`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp) combines rows that have the same value in a particular column and is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions to perform multiple mathematical operations at once. The syntax is:\n~~~sql\n\nGROUP BY column_name\n\n~~~\n\nwhere the rows are grouped by identical values within the column specified. For instance, using `GROUP BY Occupation` on the customer table will create a single row for each unique occupation. Any aggregate function will then be applied to the values in the rows that were grouped together for a particular occupation.\n\n`GROUP BY` is used after `SELECT` and any conditionals such as `WHERE` or `CASE...END`, but before `ORDER BY`.",

For instance,\n\n~~~sql\nSELECT * FROM call\nWHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM customer)\n~~~\n\nThis would first select all of the values in the `CustomerID` column from the `customer` table and then uses that as a parameter to select all of the rows from the `call` table where one of those `CustomerID` values is present. This is especially useful if you have a column with values from multiple tables and would like your query to only select for ones that come from a single table.\n\nIn the case of our `call` table, it should only have `AgentID` values that match values from the `agent` table, but we can use the `IN` keyword to make sure. We ran a query at the start that showed we have 9,940 calls in our `call` table.

This operation is known as an **alias** and is useful for more than just tidying up the result of your queries (read more about aliases [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp)). One functional use of an alias is in what's called an *implicit* `JOIN`, which is a join statement that doesn't use the `JOIN` keyword at all. Instead it uses aliases to identify which table to query the requested information from. The syntax for an implicit `JOIN` is as follows:\n\n~~~sql\nSELECT a.column_from_table_a, b.column_from_table_b\nFROM table_a AS a, table_b AS b\nWHERE a.shared_column = b.shared_column\n~~~\n\nAs you can see, we defined the alias for each of our tables in the `FROM` statement and then referenced the alias in our requested columns by using a `.` in the `SELECT` statement, referred to as **dot notation.** We still use our `WHERE` statement to say on what column our tables are to be joined.\n\nBy putting both our requested tables in the `FROM` statement and then using our aliases, SQL can infer that we intend to `JOIN` these tables without needing to use the specific keyword.\n\nNote that \"_\" isn't part of the actual SQL syntax; it is just a way to write table names when they have spaces in them. in SQL it is best to avoid having spaces in table names, so instead of naming a table \"my table\" you should name it \"my_table\".",
