Therefore virtually all of the writing that remains from ancient civilizations was produced by a tiny minority of highly-educated scribes (people who specialized in writing and reading).\n\nScribes were very important people in society. There were even statues made of them! Here's a statuette of a famous Egyptian scribe from 3,500 years ago. This man was called Minnakht, and you can see him reading hieroglyphs from the papyrus on his lap:\n\n![Egyptian scribe](data/images/minnakht.jpg)",

The figure is even higher (nearly 100%) in most developed countries. Imagine if we had to hire a scribe in order to write an email, make a grocery shopping list, or understand TV ads!\n\n**Data literacy** is becoming the new literacy. Increases in computer processing and storage power are adding to the value of data, and those who know how to work with data are the new scribes. Today, understanding how to interpret data is becoming as important as traditional literacy. \n\nNot many people can reliably interpret a bar chart, a line chart, or a frequency table, yet being able to do so would make them much more attuned to the world around them. People with data literacy skills can find better jobs, make better health decisions, plan their financial lives more judiciously, and be more informed citizens. Many companies hire highly-skilled data analysts and data scientists to help them make sense of all the data they routinely gather, but sometimes these people struggle to make the wider organization understand what they do and how the insights they produce can be useful for the business. In some sense, data workers are modern scribes.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. Although data scientists and analysts are still necessary, the modern economy demands people who are confident about their data skills and can help disseminate and take action on data-derived knowledge across their organizations. The good news is that just as we learned how to read and write in our native human languages in school, we can also learn how to read and write in the language of data. That is what this program is all about!\n\nBut what *is* data literacy? We define it as *the ability to read, write, translate, and think about data*:\n\n<img src=\"data/images/data_literacy_diagram.svg\" alt=\"COVID dashboard\" style=\"width:620px\">\n\nLet's break down what we mean by this.",

Recognizing the symbols used to represent data. When reading text, we need to recognize letters and words - in data, we need to understand what each chart type, table, statistic, etc. means.\n2. Understanding the relationships between those symbols so that they can be connected to create coherent narratives or stories (just like how words are strung together to create articles and books).\n\nIn that sense, data analyses are like stories that need to be read correctly to be fully understood, similar to when you read a story in the news. In a proper data analysis, you will have charts, tables, and statistical quantities that, when considered together, can effectively answer the questions that the analyst needs to answer. Below are some examples of *dashboards* (organized aesthetic pages consisting of charts, tables, and statistical quantities). Don't worry if you don't understand them yet - by the end of this program you will be reading (and *creating*!) beautiful, professional dashboards like these.",
