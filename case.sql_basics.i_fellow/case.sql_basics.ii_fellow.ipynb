It is time to unearth the clues stored in the database and dig deeper into the list of suspects. Sometimes things are not what they seem, and it is necessary to analyze the evidence objectively, but without losing the nose that, as an investigator, you have developed over the years. \n\n**Business Problem**: Based on the evidence stored in the database, you have to find out: **Who is the murderer?**\n\n**Analytical Context**: In this case, we will examine data from a relational database consisting of 7 tables with an average of 10,000 records per table.

The point is that we need to temporarily store these results and be able to perform queries on them. To do this we will use a fairly new feature in the SQL language: [**Common Table Expressions (CTE)**](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html), also known as \"`WITH` queries\". CTE allows us to (1) work with a set of rows for the duration of a single statement and (2) write subqueries making the overall SQL statement easier to read and understand.\n\nThe structure of a CTE is:\n\n```sql\nWITH cte_name AS (cte_definition)\nSELECT â€¦\nFROM cte_name;\n\n```\nBasically, CTEs let us assign a temporary name to a query and then reference that name in another query to avoid having to write code that is too complex. The cell below shows how to define a CTE named `cte_suspects` with the query that extracts the suspects. Notice how once you define the CTE, it is possible to make another query on those results.",
