It's the familiar voice of one of your high-profile contacts from Washington. He wants you, the most renowned private investigator in town, to help the FBI solve a top-secret cold case. Will you be up to the challenge?\n\n![The Red Telephone](data/images/phone.jpg)\n\nHe tells you there was a murder back in 2018, but the first investigation didn't produce any definitive results. The bad news is that the original crime scene data was lost because it was stored in Excel workbooks, and the Excel files got corrupted some time after the case was archived. As if that was not enough, the detective who led the inquiry back then forgot many of the key details of the case! The only thing she vaguely recalls is that the crime occurred sometime on Feb. 18, 2018. The good news is that the data was copied to a \"relational database\" (more on that later) before the Excel files were corrupted. All the clues that you will need to solve the case are buried there.\n\nYou are always down for a good mystery, so you *of course* say yes!",

There are other tools with greater potential.\n\n![from_excel_to_db](./data/images/from_excel_to_db.png)\n\nAlthough Excel is great, it has its limitations. For starters, [Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3) files have a maximum size of 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns, and in practice the limit is much smaller than that because many personal computers can't handle that amount of data along with Excel's user interface at the same time. Furthermore, while having a single very large table may not be so bad, the situation becomes more complicated when you have to look up the data in that table in another very large table, which in turn references another table, etc. After a bunch of [`VLOOKUP`](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1)s across several large tables, not only will your Excel crash, but you will also risk losing your data!\n\n\nOn top of that, collaboration is difficult in Excel - how would you allow your colleagues to work together on the same spreadsheet as you? One option could be to use Excel Online or Google Spreadsheets, but although these tools are excellent for collaboration on small datasets, they are not optimal for bigger tasks like the one we are describing.\n\nFor these reasons, and many more, professional data analysts (and professional private detectives too!) use [**relational databases**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) instead. Relational databases are purpose-built to do all the tasks we have just mentioned in a very efficient and secure way.",

      "source": "### What is a relational database?\n\nThere's no single definition for the word database. In general, databases are systems for managing information. Databases can have varying amounts of structure imposed on the data. When the data is more structured, it can help people and computers work with the data more efficiently.\n\nRelational databases are probably the most well-known kind of database. At their heart, relational databases are made up of **tables**, which are a lot like spreadsheets. Each column in the table has a name and a data type (text, number, etc.), and each row in the table is a specific instance of whatever the table is about. Relational databases get their name from the term **relations**, which is another way to refer to tables. So you could say that relational databases are indeed \"table-based databases\"!\n\nFor example, one of the tables (relations) in the cold case database contains information about people. The first few rows of that table are below:\n\n\n| id |                name |  driver_id |               address |         ssn |    income |\n|---:|--------------------:|-----------:|----------------------:|------------:|----------:|\n|  1 |         Herve Lilie | 7023162704 | 9663 Mockingbird Lane | 156-14-0067 | \\$63163.25 |\n|  2 |    Jacqueline Colam | 4722687668 |  1396 Westport Circle | 733-53-7490 | \\$94851.22 |\n|  3 |       Keenan Treker | 9198946080 |   4 Glendale Junction | 380-51-1574 | \\$58070.55 |\n|  4 |     Kimbell Everill |   39201465 |      107 Hovde Circle | 415-98-5200 | \\$40770.06 |\n|  5 | Abramo De Bernardis | 7411450154 |  8251 Maple Wood Park | 657-03-1688 | \\$89059.97 |\n\nYou can see that this table has an `id` column to uniquely identify each person. We call identifying columns **primary keys**. Thus, `id` is this table's primary key. You can also see other columns like `name`, `driver_id`, `address`, etc. These are called **attributes**. Each row corresponds to one person and is called a **tuple**.",

We call them **Entity Relationship Diagrams**, or **ERD**s for short.\n\nAn ERD is a visual representation of the relationships between all the relevant tables within a database. You can find the ERD of our cold case database below. Take some time to go over all the tables and understand the structure of the database. The diagram shows that each table has a name (at the top) and a list of the attributes with their data types. A key icon indicates that the column is the primary key of the corresponding table. The blue lines mean that two tables are linked to each other. We link tables using **foreign keys**. A foreign key is an attribute that is used to reference data in one table from another table. For example, the attribute `driver_id` in the `individual` table is a foreign key because it points to an attribute in another table, the `id` attribute of the `drivers` table.\n\n![ERD](data/images/er.png)\n\nBy knowing how all the relations in the database are linked to each other, you can narrow down your research to find out exactly what data you need to extract and where to look for it.",

A good thing about SQL is that queries read like natural English (for the most part), although they have a much more limited vocabulary. The word that databases like the most is **`SELECT`**, which lets you access data from a table or set of tables. They like it even more if once you have finished your query, you end it with a semicolon (**`;`**), which lets it know you're done asking.

For example, `Ca%a` matches `Canada` and `California` because both words start with \"Ca\" and end with an \"a\".\n\nThe other, less commonly used wildcard, is `_`. This one means 'match the rest of the text, as long as there's exactly one character in exactly the position of the `_`, no matter what it is. So, `B_b` would match `Bob` and `Bub` but not `Babe` or `Bb`.\n\n**Important:** When using wildcards, you don't use the `=` symbol; you use the **`LIKE`** keyword instead.\n\n![](data/images/fingerprints.jpg)",
