They are also a growing part of the video game industry, especially since the advent of affordable and high-quality live streaming technology. As a junior data analyst at a marketing consulting firm, you were requested by one of your colleagues to find and prepare some data about the most popular and highest-earning gamers in the world. Your colleague will analyze this data to provide information for an important upcoming marketing campaign.\n",
