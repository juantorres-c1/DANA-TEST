        "\n",
        "However, programming languages are much more strict in enforcing these rules than human languages are. If the rules of a programming language are not followed exactly, your program won’t **compile**, which means that the computer was not able to translate your instructions into machine code. On the flip side, the fact that they are strict makes it easier for a group of people to read and work on code together (a huge boon as great things are often created by teams) and makes what the code does unambiguous.\n",

        "* It is **open-source**, which means that it is free to use and, even better - other people in the Python community constantly add more functionality to the language for free!\n",
        "\n",
        "When you are going to code a program, you almost never start from scratch - you usually use code that was built by someone else beforehand that does a certain thing. For example, if I want to write a program that analyzes data and needs to find the average of a set of numbers, I don’t need to write the code that finds the average myself! Since it is a common problem, it’s likely that someone else already created code specifically for that purpose. I can then download that functionality from the Internet, import it into my program, and use it without much hassle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Such functionalities written by other people and usable by anyone in a language are called **libraries** or **packages**. Python has libraries for anything you can think of. For the previous example, there’s the `numpy` library, which contains functionality for numerous math-heavy computations. You want to visualize your data through plots? You can use `matplotlib`, it will enable you to plot different kind of charts such as scatter plots, bar plots and much more. You want something for interacting with Excel files? You can use `openpyxl`.\n",
